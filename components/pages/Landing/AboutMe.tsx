        Ever since I was a kid, I haven&apos;t just loved playing video
        gamesâ€”I&apos;ve been obsessed with how they&apos;re made. That curiosity
        is what first led me to programming. I spent two years diving in
        headfirst, learning everything I could. While I quickly realized that
        building a full game was a huge challenge, I fell in love with the
        process of building itself. I shifted my focus to web development,
        originally with a simple goal: to earn enough for a better PC. But along
        the way, I discovered a real passion for creating things that live on
        the web. That was over three years ago, and I&apos;ve been hooked ever
        since. My journey might have started with game engines, but it&apos;s
        led me to a career I truly love, building fast, beautiful, and
        user-friendly websites.
